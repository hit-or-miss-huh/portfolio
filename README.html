    <h3>What is the GOBDASM?</h3>
    <p>The GOBDASM is a simple collection of outdated memes. The word "GOBDASM" is an acronym for...</p>
    <div class="divination">
      <p>Graveyard</p>
      <p>Of</p>
      <p>Broken</p>
      <p>Dreams</p>
      <p>And</p>
      <p>Slaughtered</p>
      <p>Memes</p>
    </div>
    <p>This means that every meme you find on this website is intentionally dead and long expired. Some of the memes might even leave a stale taste in your mouth from when you enjoyed such a cringy topic.</p>

    <h3>What can I do on the GOBDASM?<h3>
    <p>At first glance, it does not appear as if there is much to the GOBDASM, but upon closer inspection, there is an abundance of info. Not only is there a grid of memes, but there are buttons everywhere!
    The buttons at the center of the page (how you got here) are genuine links to my other pages, like my music account. The buttons at the bottom of the screen go unnoticed by most who visit, but include great images.
    However, that leaves out the most important part. The tabs at the top of the screen are the beef of the GOBDASM. With a wide variety of rhyming words, there are many options to choose from.
    These include: backstory, battlefields, glitches, a very specific kink, our merch page, and most importantly: the More tab, which takes you to almost any video imaginable.</p>
